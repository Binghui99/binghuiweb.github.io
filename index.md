## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore. My research interests are network security, network traffic analysis, artificial intelligence, and Trustworthy Machine Learning.
I love sports, books, and movies.

## Research Interests

- **Network Security:** IoT fingerprinting, website fingerprinting, anomaly detection, trustworthy AI
- **Machine Learning:** sequence model, few-shot and zero-shot learning, incremental learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Dec. 2023]** Our paper about zero-short learning is accpeted to IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2024.
